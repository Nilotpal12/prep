One of the most impactful systems I worked on was the auto-verification and reconciliation flow for cashouts and deposits via payment gateways like Brite and Zimpler.

The goal was to eliminate manual intervention for most cashouts and reduce mismatches between internal ledgers and gateway responses.

My role involved backend ownership in a Java Spring Boot-based microservice. I integrated new business rules into the cashout verification engine and improved the transaction ID generation logic to support better traceability and uniqueness — including Redis-based atomic increment logic and Snowflake ID evaluation for distributed safety.

I also worked on upgrading the service from Java 8 to Java 21, which involved adapting lambda-heavy logic, stream rewrites, and deprecating older APIs. For logging, I implemented Singleton pattern wrappers (including enum-based singletons) for system-wide logger management, improving log consistency and minimizing GC churn.

One of the major challenges was gateway flakiness — particularly Brite’s delayed confirmations. I implemented retry mechanisms, exponential backoff, and fallback triggers with idempotent handling for duplicate callbacks.

As a result, we achieved a ~95% auto-verification rate, reduced manual reconciliation load by ~80%, and brought down failed transaction reversals significantly. These systems are now used in production to process high-volume financial flows every day.

This project taught me how important clean LLD, smart retry logic, and observability are when building real-world financial systems at scale.
